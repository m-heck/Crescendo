# :mute: Crescendo
Annoyed by the PHUUOOOOOOOOOOOM sound the League client makes after you've accepted a queue? Wish it'd just shut up until you loaded into champion select? **Crescendo** runs in the background and will automatically mute your League when you've accepted or declined the ready check.

# FAQ
**Where can I download Crescendo?**  
Click the [Releases](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Crescendo/releases) link on the right to download the latest version.

**Is this approved by Riot?**  
Cresendo conforms to both the [general Riot Developer policies](https://developer.riotgames.com/policies.html) and the [League Client development policies](https://developer.riotgames.com/league-client-apis.html), and it is registered on Riot's developer portal. While this doesn't mean that Riot explicitly approves the application or supports it in any way, it makes it increasingly unlikely that using this application will risk your account. [This comment by RiotSargonas](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/80d4r0/runebook_the_ultimate_rune_pages_manager_that_you/duv2r22/) explains more about Riot's approach to applications like this one.

**How do I uninstall?**  
Since Crescendo doesn't actually install anything, removing it is as simple as deleting the file from your Downloads folder!

**Wow this is amazing! Do you have any other cool programs?**  
_shameless plug start_   
As a matter of fact I do! I created [Mimic](http://mimic.molenzwiebel.xyz/desktop), which is a client on your mobile phone. I also created [Deceive](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Deceive), which allows you to appear offline to all your friends. Finally, I created [Sentinel](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Sentinel), which gives you proper desktop notifications when you receive a new message or invite on League.
